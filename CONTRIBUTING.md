# Contributing to Gardens v2

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gardens v2! We're excited to have you help build the future of modular governance and community-driven decision making.

Gardens v2 is a modular governance framework that enables communities to create and manage multiple governance pools with customizable parameters and voting mechanisms. As an open-source project, we welcome contributions from developers, designers, writers, and community members of all skill levels.

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (v8.14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A GitHub account

### First Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gardens-v2.git
   cd gardens-v2
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/1Hive/gardens-v2.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Open the workspace** in VSCode (recommended):
   ```bash
   code gardens-v2.code-workspace
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Environment

Gardens v2 is a monorepo with several packages:

### Frontend Development (`apps/web`)

For frontend contributions:

1. **Navigate to the web app**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in the required environment variables (contact us in Discord for help with API keys)

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3000

### Smart Contracts Development (`pkg/contracts`)

For smart contract contributions:

1. **Install Foundry** (required for contract development):

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

2. **Navigate to contracts package**:

   ```bash
   cd pkg/contracts
   ```

3. **Build contracts**:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

> **Note**: Foundry is only required for smart contract development. Frontend contributors can skip this setup.

### Subgraph Development (`pkg/subgraph`)

For subgraph contributions:

1. **Navigate to subgraph package**:

   ```bash
   cd pkg/subgraph
   ```

2. **Build the subgraph**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **üêõ Bug fixes**: Help us squash bugs in the codebase
- **‚ú® New features**: Implement new governance features or improvements
- **üìñ Documentation**: Improve guides, API docs, or code comments
- **üé® UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the user experience
- **üß™ Testing**: Add or improve test coverage
- **üåê Translations**: Help make Gardens accessible globally
- **üîç Code review**: Review pull requests from other contributors

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** on GitHub to see if your idea is already being worked on
2. **Join our Discord** to discuss your contribution idea with the community
3. **Review our [New Contributor Onboarding](https://1hive-gardens.notion.site/Gardens-New-Contributor-Onboarding-8ab2e08a585c46e3bcb36482d006c9e9?pvs=4)** guide

## üìã Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Write responsive designs using Tailwind CSS
- Follow the established folder structure

### Solidity (Smart Contracts)

- Follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html)
- Use NatSpec documentation for all public functions
- Write comprehensive test coverage
- Use proper access modifiers
- Follow established patterns for upgradeable contracts

## üß™ Testing

### Running Lint/Tests

#### Frontend linting and building

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

#### Contract tests (requires Foundry)

```bash
cd pkg/contracts
forge test
```

#### Lint all packages

```bash
cd ../../
pnpm lint
```

#### Build all packages from root (note: contracts require Foundry)

```bash
cd ../../
pnpm build
```

> **Note**: The full `pnpm build` command will fail without Foundry installed, but this doesn't affect frontend development. Frontend contributors can work with individual package builds.

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality

## üöÄ Deployment and Release

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- Name your branches based on the feature or fix (e.g., `feature/new-governance-pool`, `fix/vote-weight-bug`)

### Release Process

1. Features are merged into `develop`
2. Release candidates are created from `develop`
3. After testing, releases are merged into `main`
