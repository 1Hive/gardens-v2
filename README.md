# Gardens v2

Gardens v2 is a modular governance framework that enables communities to create and manage multiple governance pools with customizable parameters and voting mechanisms. Our smart contracts are built to optimize for secure, flexible, intuitive, multi-network governance solutions.

üåê **[Launch Gardens v2 App](https://app.gardens.fund/)**

## Features

### Modular Governance Pools

Create multiple governance pools within your community, each serving a distinct purpose with customizable parameters and terms of use. This modular approach allows for more granular and focused onchain governance decisions.

### Pool Types

- **Funding Pools**: Allocate funds from a shared token pool
- **Signaling Pools**: Source other types of decisions, both onchain and offchain

### Flexible Voting Weight Systems

Choose from multiple voting weight mechanisms to best suit your community's needs:

- **Token-weighted**: Traditional 1 token = 1 vote
- **Fixed**: Equal voting power for all members
- **Quadratic**: Voting weight = square root of .tokens staked
- **Capped**: 1 token = 1 vote up to a maximum threshold

### Multi-Network Support

Currently deployed on:

- Gnosis Chain
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- Celo

_More networks coming soon!_

### Enhanced User Experience
