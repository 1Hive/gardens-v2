title: "Allocate Voting Power"
---

This feature allows participants to strategically allocate their voting power based on the importance or impact of each proposal, ensuring that their support is aligned with their priorities and preferences. When managing your support, you will see three different percentages:

**Your pool weight / Your governance weight: **This represents your influence within a specific pool, determined by the number of tokens you've staked and the pool system in place.

** Pool weight used: **This indicates how much of the pool weight has been allocated to proposals. You can only allocate up to the amount of your total pool weight / governance weight.

**Total allocated: **This percentage reflects how much of your pool weight is being used to support  proposals.

By managing these percentages, you can fine-tune your support for proposals, ensuring that your voice is heard and your priorities are reflected in the community's decision-making process.
