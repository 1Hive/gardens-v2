title: "Dispute"
---

Once you clearly identify a proposal that is in disagreement with the Covenant you can dispute that proposal, submitting a dispute notice through the platform.

To submit a dispute, a collateral is required, similar to the collateral needed when creating a proposal. Once the dispute is submitted, the **Tribunal**** **has one week to review the case and reach a decision.

The possible outcomes of this process are either approval or rejection of the dispute. It is important to note that if the dispute is ultimately lost, the collateral submitted will be forfeited.
