*Gardens is a bottom-up governance framework for web3 ecosystems. We provide coordination infrastructure and funding mechanisms that help grow networks of public goods, run by the individuals and communities that understand them best. *

Our emphasis is on a community experience thatâ€™s healthy, fun, intuitive, secure, and open.

All of our code is open-source. Always has been and always will be.  ðŸŒ±

## Our Mission

Our goal is to increase the ROI for expenditures on non-private goods.

Tragically, many of our worldâ€™s most valuable resources arenâ€™t naturally suited for private-ownership business models. Instead, we rely on governments and nonprofits - and too often these fall short.

Our public goods are catastrophically underfunded and mismanaged as a result.

Enter cryptocurrency - a sandbox for new economic and governance models, and our technology of choice in taking on this challenge.

Our approach at Gardens is to give organizations streamlined access to cutting edge coordination mechanisms. Our initial focus is on Conviction Voting, Quadratic Voting, and Streaming Proposals, which communities can use to make decisions or invest their treasuries in any combination of instances.
