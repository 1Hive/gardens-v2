In Gardens, ecosystems represent the broad, overarching domains where various communities operate. Each ecosystem is permissionless, meaning any ERC-20 token can establish one, allowing for a wide range of governance and resource management activities.

Ecosystems are decentralized, with no inherent management rights over the communities that exist within them, fostering a diverse and autonomous environment.
