Pools are the functional units within communities where resources are managed and allocated based on community decisions. Pools are permissioned, meaning only the Council Safe can approve the creation of new Pools, ensuring a controlled environment for resource distribution. They form the foundation for the implementation of various strategies, such as Conviction Voting.

## Pool systems:

## Fixed

In a fixed points system, each member is allocated an equal number of points that remain constant over time. This model provides predictability in governance participation but may limit flexibility and responsiveness to community dynamics.

## Capped

Impose a maximum limit on the number of points a member can accumulate or use. This approach encourages participation while preventing any single member from dominating the decision-making process, promoting a more equitable governance structure.

## Unlimited

Allows members to accumulate and use as many points as they earn without restrictions. This model incentivizes active participation and engagement but may lead to imbalances if a few members accumulate excessive influence.

## Quadratic

The influence of points grows at a diminishing rate. This means that while members can increase their voting power by accumulating points, the additional influence gained from each new point decreases. This system encourages broader participation and prevents a concentration of power among a few members, promoting a more democratic governance process.
