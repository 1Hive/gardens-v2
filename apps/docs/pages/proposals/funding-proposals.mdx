Funding  proposals are designed to request financial support from the Community Pool for specific community projects or initiatives. When a member submits a funding proposal, it outlines the objectives, required resources, and expected outcomes of the project. The community then evaluates these proposals based on their potential impact and feasibility.

Key characteristics of funding proposals include:

1. **Resource Allocation: **Funding proposals specify the amount of tokens needed from the  pool. The success of these proposals depends on community backing (Conviction), as members can allocate their voting power to support them. 
2. **Impact Assessment: **The proposals are assessed not only for their funding requirements but also for their potential benefits to the community, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.
