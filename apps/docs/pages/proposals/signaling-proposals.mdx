title: "Signaling Proposals"
---

Signaling proposals are used to gauge community sentiment regarding changes or initiatives without requesting financial resources. These proposals allow members to express their opinions and preferences on various issues affecting the community. Key characteristics of signaling proposals include:

**Expression of Conviction:** Members can allocate their staked tokens to signal support or opposition for a proposal. This mechanism helps the community understand the level of consensus or dissent regarding specific changes.

**No Financial Request:** Unlike funding proposals, signaling proposals do not involve a request for tokens from the common pool. Instead, they focus on gathering feedback and guiding future discussions.

**Influence on Decision-Making:** The outcomes of signaling proposals can influence the direction of future initiatives, as they reflect the community's collective priorities and concerns.
