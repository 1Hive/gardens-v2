## Activate Governance

Activating or Deactivating Governance enables community members to turn governance features on or off for each pool, affecting their ability to support proposals.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please be cautious when deactivating your governance. If you've allocated or
  supported proposals, deactivating will remove all your support from those
  proposals.
