title: "Create a Proposal"
---

Creating a proposal is the process through which members can suggest changes or initiatives for the community to consider.

Proposals are submitted for discussion and voting, allowing participants to actively shape the direction of the community. There are currently two types of proposals that affect distribution:

[**Signaling proposals**](/proposals/signaling-proposals), which do not request tokens and [**Funding proposals**](/proposals/funding-proposals), which do. To create a proposal, members must provide collateral, serving two purposes: first, to prevent spam proposals, and second, to act as security in case of disputes.

Once the proposal is executed, the collateral is returned to the member.
