title: "Create a Pool"
---

Creating a Pool allows members to aggregate resources for specific purposes. In Gardens v2, there are two types of pools: funding pools, which are used to finance community projects, and signaling pools, which gauge community sentiment on specific issues.

This collective resource management enhances collaboration and enables more significant investments in community goals.

Each pool created requires council review to be effectively launched.
