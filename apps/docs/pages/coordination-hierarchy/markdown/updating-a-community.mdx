## Modifiable Community Parameters

Several key parameters of the community can be modified to suit evolving needs. These parameters fall into two categories: **standard modifications** and ** special requirements**.

## Key Modifiable Parameters:

- **Community Name**: Update the name that represents the community.
- **Community Fee**: Modify the fee structure that members must contribute.
- **Fee Receiver**: Change the wallet or entity that receives the community fees.
- **Council Safe**: The secure entity responsible for governance and major decisions.

## Special Requirements for Modification:

Some parameters require the community to have **no active members** at the time of modification. This restriction is in place to ensure that these critical changes are implemented without disrupting member activities or governance. The parameters with this requirement are:

- **Register Stake Amount**: The amount required for new members to register.
- **Allow Kicking Members (Kick Enabled)**: Enabling or disabling the option to remove members.
- **Covenant**: The community’s rules and agreements that guide its operations.

### How to Modify the Council Safe

The **Council Safe** can be updated through the Community Parameters page. Here’s the process:

1. **Initiation**: The change must be initiated by the current Council Safe.
2. **Confirmation**: The new Council Safe must confirm this change by connecting to the Gardens page and accepting the new role.
