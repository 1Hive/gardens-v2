title: "Funding Pools"
---

In Gardens v2, Funding pools are designed to receive proposals for funding community projects. Members can allocate a portion of their pool voting power to support proposals based on their conviction in their merits and potential impact.

The level of support a proposal receives influences its likelihood of approval. Members can manage their support by adjusting the percentage of their staked tokens allocated to each proposal, aligning their voting power with their priorities.

Each funding proposal has an execution threshold based on the requested amount relative to the total funds available in the  pool. Higher funding requests require greater community backing to secure approval. If a proposal meets this threshold, the execute function is ready to be trigger. When execution happends, requested  funds are allocated to the beneficiary, enabling the project to move forward and fostering a collaborative environment for community participation.
