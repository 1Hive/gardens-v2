Signaling Pools are another type of pool in Gardens v2 that are used for proposals related to changes or improvements within the community. When a proposal is submitted to a Signaling Pool, members can signal their agreement by allocating a portion of their staked tokens to support or oppose the proposal.

The level of support in a Signaling Pool serves as a gauge of the community's sentiment, helping to inform decision-making and guide future discussions. By participating in Signaling Pools, members can actively shape the direction of the community and contribute to the ongoing evolution of the community.

The conviction-based voting system allows members to have a meaningful impact on the proposals that matter most to them.
