title: "Conviction 101"
---

Conviction Voting is a disputable, time-weighted voting mechanism where proposal support grows in strength the longer it's allocated (and shrinks over time if support is removed).

It encourages ongoing participation, favoring consistent, long-term ideas and contributors, and it protects communities from short-term manipulation and abuse.

The mechanism was first conceived by BlockScience in 2019: [https://github.com/BlockScience/conviction](https://github.com/BlockScience/conviction)
