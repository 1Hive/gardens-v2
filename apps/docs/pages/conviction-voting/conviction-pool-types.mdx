title: "Conviction Pool Types"
---

There are different Pool Types that can be set up in a community to meet the need for different applications of Conviction Voting.

## Funding

Funding Pools are linked to a pool of tokens, which can be requested in discrete amounts in a Proposal. If a Proposal reaches a required conviction threshold - calculated by its support and the Pool's parameters - anyone can execute the proposal and distribute funds to the recipient.

The more funds requested in a proposal, the more conviction needed for the Proposal to pass.

## Signaling

Signaling Pools do not link Proposals to any executable onchain actions. Proposals simply accumulate conviction, which the community can see and use to make decisions, or optionally set up their own onchain executable action with another smart contract.

## Streaming (coming soon)

Streaming Pools link Proposals to a pool of tokens that are streamed to beneficiaries using Superfluid. More conviction on a proposal = more tokens streamed to the beneficiary.  A conviction threshold parameter decides a minimum amount of conviction for the stream to begin.
