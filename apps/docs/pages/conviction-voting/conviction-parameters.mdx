title: "Conviction Parameters"
---

Conviction Voting allows proposals to be evaluated continuously and concurrently. Participants can express their preferences for the proposals they support, and their support accumulates over time. Any actions connected to a Conviction Voting Pool - like a funding distribution - are only executable when Conviction reaches a calculated threshold.

## Conviction growth

**Pool Types = Funding, Signaling, Streaming**

Determines the rate at which a proposal accumulates conviction.

A higher value for Conviction Growth means proposals will take longer to accumulate strength based on their support. This parameter is logarithmic and represents its "half-life," or the amount of time for conviction to reach 50% of its support.

Example:

- Conviction Growth = 7 days.
- Alice has 10% of a Pool's voting weight, and supports Proposal B with all of her voting weight. After leaving her support allocated for 14 days, conviction on Proposal B is 7.5%, or 2 half-lifes.

## Minimum Conviction

**Pool Types = Funding, Streaming**

In a Funding Pool, minimum conviction is the minimum voting weight needed for a proposal to pass. This parameter is defined as a percentage of total voting weight in a pool, and sets the amount of conviction needed for the smallest possible funding proposal (i.e. 0 tokens) to pass.

In a Streaming Pool, minimum conviction is the percentage of voting weight needed for the tokens to begin streaming.

## Spending Limit

**Pool Types = Funding**

The spending limit caps the number of tokens that can be requested in a single proposal. This parameter is defined as a percentage of tokens in the funding pool, and sets the amount of tokens requested where the proposal cannot be passed because 100% of the Pool's voting weight would need to accumulate conviction.

## Fixed Minimum Threshold

**Pool Types = Funding**

This threshold is a fixed value representing the minimum voting weight that conviction must reach for a proposal to pass.

This parameter overrides the Minimum Conviction parameter when its value is greater, and is a safeguard for newly created Pools or Pools that for any other reason do not have enough voting weight activated for funds to be considered secure.
