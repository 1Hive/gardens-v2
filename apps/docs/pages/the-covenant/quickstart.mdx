The keystone of Gardens v2 infrastructure is the Community Covenant, which serves to:

1. Encode a community’s values / mission in an onchain social contract
2. Enforce that Covenant in the community’s funding and decision-sourcing smart contracts.
3. Allow people to signal support for a community by staking tokens in the Covenant.

The Covenant is the North Star for Gardens communities, guiding members towards a shared vision that they collectively create.
